# To-do-list
A To-Do list is a list of tasks we require to complete or things we would like to do.

Most typically, the tasks in this list are arranged in order of priority. By tradition, they are written on a piece of paper or post-it notes and act as a memory aid. Due to the evolution in technology, we have been able to create a To-Do lists with Excel Spreadsheets, Word Documents, E-mail Lists, and To-Do List applications like Microsoft to-do and Google to-do lists. We can utilize a to-do list in our home, workplace, or personal life.

Having a list of everything we are supposed to do written down in one place implies that we should not forget anything significant. By prioritizing the tasks in the list, we can play the order of doing them and quickly observe what requires our immediate attention and what tasks can be delayed for a while.

Understanding the Advantages of using a To-Do List
One of the significant reasons to use a to-do list is that it will support us in staying planned. Whenever we write all the tasks in a list, they appear more convenient. When we have a clear outline of the tasks that require action and those we have completed, it supports us in staying concentrated. At the same time, releasing the space in our minds for other, more creative tasks.

When we finish a task, we can either mark it down or cross it off the list. This provides us with a sense of progress and achievement, something we will lack if we always rush from one task to the next. If we feel a sense of achievement, it spurs us on and motivates us to keep moving.

However, that's not the only advantage of a To-Do list. Some of the advantages of using a To-Do list are shown below:

It helps improve memory. A To-Do list acts as an external memory aid which is only possible while a few pieces of information at a time. Keeping a to-do list allows us to keep track of everything, rather than just some of the tasks we need to perform. The To-Do list will also reinforce the information, making things less likely to be forgotten.
It also helps increase productivity. A To-Do list enables the user to prioritize the more significant tasks. The list will help us stay concentrated on many important tasks. This statement implies that we do not have to waste time on tasks that do not require our immediate attention.
It also supports with motivation. The To-Do lists are a great motivational tool as they help us clarify our objectives. We can divide the long-term objectives into smaller, more achievable short-term milestones, and as we mark each one off the list, our confidence will get boosted.
Now that we have learned about the To-Do lists and their benefits, it is time to start building a To-Do list application to manage our day-to-day tasks.
